### AIM OF PROJECT
This project aims to create a fully functional Login/SignUp Registration Form using Java, with MySQL database integration to manage user authentication.

### Steps Involved in Project
1. **Database Setup**: Create a MySQL database and table with initial values to verify the login functionality later.

   - **Login Form**: Includes two labels (Username/Email and Password), two text fields, and buttons for Login and Register.
   - **SignUp Form**: Includes text fields for First Name, Last Name, Email, Password, and a Signup button.
   
3. **Login Verification**: After coding the login form, verify if the user can successfully log in using credentials stored in the database.
   
4. **SignUp Process**: If login fails or a new user needs to register, click on the "Register Now" button to open the SignUp form, fill in the details, and store the new user information in the database.

5. **Completion**: After successful signup, users can log in using their newly created credentials.

### How to Run
